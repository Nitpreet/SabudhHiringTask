# Project_Euler Problem 45
Firstly I tried list for saving all the pentagonal, hexagonal and triangle numbers. But the lists were not efficient enough. They were taking more than 7-8 minutes for saving the same.
Then I tried set and I was surprised that it took only a few seconds to save all the pentagonal, hexagonal  and triangle numbers to the set.
