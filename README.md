# Project_Euler Problem 45
Firstly I tried list for saving all the pentagonal, hexagonal and triangle numbers. 
But the lists were not efficient enough. They were taking more than 7-8 minutes for saving the same.
Then I tried set and I was surprised that it took only a few seconds to save all the pentagonal, hexagonal  and triangle numbers to the set.

# Endpoints
There are 4 endpoints and the request methods for all the endpoints should be post method:
1. <mark>/create: </mark> Json should have the following keys. The example is as shown:
{"id":2,"name":"Nitpreet Taneja","address":"Ludhiana","phone_number":1234567890}. This will create a new entry in both mysql and mongodb.
